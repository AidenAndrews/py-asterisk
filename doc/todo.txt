Todo List For py-Asterisk.

    - Import old public domain AGI.py or rewrite it. At the least refactor it
      to not be so terrible.

    - Status/ParkedCalls/ShowZapChannels/etc. can only be used asyncronously,
      they cannot be used to simply trigger sending of events. This is wrong,
      but how do I fix?
